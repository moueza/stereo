   The cursor bitmaps and the cursor initialisation routines are from
   the DND package which can be found with the OffiX package at
   sunsite.unc.edu. These are Copyright (C) 1996 César Crusius.
   I also took a look at his code to get a better idea how get my Dnd
   working the same, and small parts of the code are modifications
   from there.
