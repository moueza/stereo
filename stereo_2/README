What is stereo?

Stereo is a tool for loading up large grey tiff/targa files of stereo
photographs and taking accurate 3D measurents from them. This
process is sometimes used by surveyors as an alternative to
physically measuring sites, and is called stereo-photometrology.

Various geometric objects can be fitted to the stereo pairs,
and then rendered in 3D, with grey shading and real time rotation
and scaling.

The package is still in its development phase, but is stable and
can be used to full effect. I do not have any intension to continue
development of this package in the near future. See the file
PROGRAMMING if you want to work on stereo.

See the directory ./MSc/ for my full M.Sc. thesis for which this
package was developed. Here you will find mathematical algorithms
and a detailed description of what the package does, as well as
its specs. See the file INSTALL for compiling the package, and
the file USAGE for a brief description of how to use the package.
The USAGE file should be read together with thesis.

PLEASE email me if you use Stereo on your system.
