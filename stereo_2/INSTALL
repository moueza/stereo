[ This comes from cooledit. During the development, 'make install'
  obviously isn't applicable. ]

The result of executing the following steps is an
executable 'main/display'. See the file USAGE for using the program.


COMPILATION PROCEDURE:
----------------------

SUMMARY:
--------

(O) un-tar package in /usr/src
(1) edit global.h for data and temp directories
(2) ./configure
(3) make


DETAILS:
--------

    Copy the file stereo-0.2.tar.gz to the directory you would
like to compile in, preferably '/usr/local/src' or '/usr/src', and
then change to that directory. (You can also compile in your home
directory.)


Then type,
    tar -xvzf stereo-0.2b.tar.gz
or
    gzip -cd stereo-0.2b.tar.gz | tar xvf -
(whichever works).


Then type,
    cd stereo-0.2b

Edit the files global.h and change the data and temp directories to those
where your calibration files and images will be stored and those where
temporary data will be written (not the /tmp directory).

You can then configure the package by just typing,
    ./configure
However if you would like to set compiler optimisations, for a
smaller binary, type,
    CFLAGS=-O ./configure
or,
    setenv CFLAGS -O
    ./configure
whichever works on your shell. (Use -O2 instead
of -O if your compiler supports this.)


Finally type
    make
to compile.


Done.
----------------------------Note-----------------------------------------
I found that when I first built Stereo, it immediately crashed on startup.
I found a define in ~/widget/stringtools.c

#define CRASHES_ON_STARTUP

which uncommented and the problem went away.
I was building on a Fedora 8 x86_64 system.
I do not know if this define will cause other problems on other systems,
so if you have strange behaviour, you might try re-commenting this define
and rebuilding, to see what effect it has.
