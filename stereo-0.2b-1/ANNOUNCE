ANNOUNCING ALPHA SOFTWARE: STEREO - VERSION 0.2
-----------------------------------------------

This is the first public release of this software.

Stereo is a tool for loading up large grey tiff/targa files of stereo
photographs and taking accurate 3D measurents from them. This
process is sometimes used by surveyors as an alternative to
physically measuring sites, and is called stereo-photometrology.

Various geometric objects can be fitted to the stereo pairs,
and then rendered in 3D, with grey shading and real time rotation
and scaling. Automatic camera calibration is featured, making the
package, on the whole, a most sophisticated piece of software.

This package was developed for my M.Sc. thesis, and contains the
entire thesis in postscript as documentation. I do not have any
intention to do extensions or maintenance, and invite anyone to
continue development. Although this is Alpha software, it is stable,
fully documented and can certainly be used.

The source code also contains a matrix library that (among other
matrix manipulation functions) can do least squares diagonalisation
of a non-square matrix.

Also contained is a widget library that can do 3D grey shaded
rendering of surfaces with hidden surface removal.
