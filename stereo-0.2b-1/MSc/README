--------------------------

This is my 'Master of Science in Engineering' research dissertation.
The dissertation was submitted to the Faculty of Engineering, University
of the Witwatersrand in May of 1997 and was confirmed in September
of the same year.

The dissertation is about 50 pages, followed by an Appendix which contains
the complete source code. Each page is in a seperate file. The appendix is
not included since the source code is given in this distribution.

Large pages containing a graphic may not print if you do not have enough
memory in your printer. You can leave these out since they probably do
not contain any writing,
