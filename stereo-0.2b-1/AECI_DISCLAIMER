AECI DISCLAIMER
---------------

This software package was developed entirely by myself for the
purposes of my Master of Science dissertation. AECI Engineering,
produced only the initial idea toward this package, and neither
they nor any of their employees made any contribution to the code
or documentation in this source tree. The quality of this software
should therefore not reflect upon AECI or any of its employees,
management, or shareholders. This disclaimer is not to the
exclusion of the file COPYING (which contains the licensing
agreement for this software, and explains the lack of warranty)
or any of its terms and conditions.
